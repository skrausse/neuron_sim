# Neural Simulator

This small project of mine is my excuse to get rusty. I want to learn some Rust basics, so I thought that implementing a simple neural simulator is a great excuse for this.

The project will be handling all the heavy simulation in Rust, and then port them through csv files to a python analysis suite.

The python code handles the visualization and subsequent analysis.
